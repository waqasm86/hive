Example format:
```
Name: DocBot
Goal: Automatically keeps documentation in sync with code changes.
      Monitors PRs and updates relevant docs.
Self-Improvement: When docs get rejected in review, it learns the feedback
                  and adjusts its writing style and coverage.
Human-in-the-Loop: Major architectural changes require human approval
                   before doc updates go live.
```
